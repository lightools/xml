## Introduction

This library provides simple interface for loading XML or HTML strings to DomDocument object.
It prevents some known vulnerabilities and allows you to handle LibXML errors simply by catching XmlException as you can see below.

## Installation

```sh
$ composer require lightools/xml
```

## Simple usage

Both loading methods (loadXml and loadHtml) return DomDocument.
If you prefer working with SimpleXmlElement, you can use [simplexml_import_dom](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.simplexml-import-dom.php) function.

```php
$xml = '<?xml version="1.0"?><root>text</root>';
$html = '<!doctype html><title>Foo</title>';

$loader = new Lightools\Xml\XmlLoader();

try {
    $xmlDomDocument = $loader->loadXml($xml);
    $htmlDomDocument = $loader->loadHtml($html);

} catch (Lightools\Xml\XmlException $e) {
    // process exception
}
```
